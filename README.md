## About the Realtime Framework
The Realtime Framework is presented in two plafforms: Realtime Cloud Storage and Realtime Cloud Messaging.

Realtime Cloud Storage is a fully managed NoSQL database service that provides fast and predictable performance with seamless scalability. You can use Realtime Cloud Storage to create database tables that can store and retrieve any amount of data, and serve any level of request traffic.

Realtime Cloud Messaging uses the Pub/Sub (publish/subscribe) messaging pattern, where senders of messages, called publishers, do not program the messages to be sent directly to specific receivers, called subscribers. Published messages are published to topic channels, without knowledge of what, if any, subscribers there may be. Similarly, subscribers express interest in one or more topic channels, and only receive messages that are of interest, without knowledge of what, if any, publishers there are.

When upgrading the Realtime package please follow these steps.

1) Delete the existing package and plugin.
2) Download and install the updated package
3) Your old settings file will need to reference the new Settings ScriptableObject script.
	- You may either update the missing reference or delete the old file,
	- If you delete the file, you will need to reapply your application key 

Thank you.
